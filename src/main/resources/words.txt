There
can
never
be
too
many
cherries
on
an
ice
cream
sundae
The
elephant
want
to
talk
about
the
person
in
the
room
When
he
asked
her
favorite
number
she
answered
without
hesitation
that
it
was
diamonds
The
trick
to
getting
kids
to
eat
anything
is
to
put
catchup
on
it
Honestly
I
care
much
for
the
first
season
so
I
bother
with
the
second
The
thick
foliage
and
intertwined
vines
made
the
hike
nearly
impossible
It
would
have
been
a
better
night
if
the
guys
next
to
us
in
the
splash
zone
Sometimes
it
is
better
to
just
walk
away
from
things
and
go
back
to
them
later
when
youâ€™re
in
a
better
frame
of
mind
He
picked
up
trash
in
his
spare
time
to
dump
in
his
neighbors
yard
He
hated
that
he
loved
what
she
hated
about
hate
I
come
from
a
tribe
of
head-hunters
so
I
will
never
need
a
shrink
He
quietly
entered
the
museum
as
the
super
bowl
started
He
was
all
business
when
he
wore
his
clown
suit
The
shark-infested
South
Pine
channel
was
the
only
way
in
or
out
The
most
exciting
eureka
moment
had
was
when
I
realized
that
the
instructions
on
food
packets
were
just
guidelines
